Ritual is a concept album that explores various themes of horror, occultism and madness, inspired by the infamous unsolved murder case of Elizabeth Short, also known as the Black Dahlia. The album features 12 tracks that range from fast and furious to slow and sinister, each one telling a different story of death and depravity.
 
Some of the highlights of the album include:
 
- A Shrine to Madness: The opening track sets the tone for the album with a haunting intro that leads into a blast of riffs and growls. The song is about a cult that worships an ancient evil entity and performs human sacrifices.
- Moonlight Equilibrium: A catchy and melodic song that contrasts with its gruesome lyrics about a vampire who seduces and kills his victims.
- On Stirring Seas of Salted Blood: A epic and atmospheric song that tells the tale of a pirate crew that encounters a monstrous sea creature.
- The Window: A creepy and claustrophobic song that describes the paranoia and hallucinations of a serial killer who believes he is being watched by a mysterious figure.
- Malenchanments of the Necrosphere: A fast and furious song that depicts a necromancer who raises an army of the undead to wage war on the living.
- Blood in the Ink: The closing track of the album that summarizes the concept with a reference to the Black Dahlia murder case. The song is about a journalist who investigates the crime scene and becomes obsessed with the case, eventually losing his sanity and becoming a killer himself.
